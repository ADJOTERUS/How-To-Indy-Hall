## First Day Questions

### How do I connect to the wireless network? What's the difference between the two networks available?

You can access our the internet from anywhere in the building, using connections named "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" and "Indy Hall 5gHz". 

Mobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.

All of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if you’re having trouble connecting.

_Short Version:_ Join the "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" network if you're not sure, and ask _anyone_ for the password.
