# How To Indy Hall 
### Your handy field guide to being an excellent Indy Hall Member

Live at http://howto.indyhall.org

While creating this guide, we asked ourselves the question:

How do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?

The result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.
