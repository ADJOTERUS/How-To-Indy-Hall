        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        
        <p>For Indy Hall, our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love.</p>
        
        <p>The Greeks had a word - eudaimonia - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as <em>"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."</em></p>
        
        <p>Sound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.**</p>
        
        <p>At the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.</p>
        
        <p>We believe in sharing the good life &amp; actively working towards it together.</p>
        
        <p>Come pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!</p>
        
        <h1>How we do it</h1>
        
        <p>Our statement of purpose sounds nice, but it can only be accomplished if we act on it. Below, we've collected a set of <strong>guiding actions</strong> that we use to make sure that we're fulfilling our purpose with every action, every single day. </p>

        ...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.<br>
        ...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.<br>
        ...trust people to do the right thing.<br>
        ...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.<br>
        ...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   </p>

        ...focus on desks or square footage.<br>
        ...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.<br>
        ...accept the status quo.<br>
        ...accept a "no" at face value.<br>
        ...compromise our core values.<br>
        ...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
        <p>...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.<br>
        ...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.<br>
        ...always look for a way to say yes.<br>
        ...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.</p>
