<h1>Part 4 - Sharing the Workspace</h1>

<h2 id="1__I_need_to_make_a_phone_call__am_I_going_to_bother_somebody_">1. I need to make a phone call, am I going to bother somebody?</h2>

<p>Don't worry, you're not the only person here who wants/needs to use the phone from time to time. Fortunately, just about everyone here has expressed the same concern of him/herself -  we're all cognizant of one another, when it comes to our own phone conversations. </p>

<p>Phone calls are best taken in the phone room on the 2nd floor by the kitchen. You're the best judge of how much noise you're going to make during a phone call. Casual client conversations are easy to manage at your pod. Angry shouting matches with your telecom services, not so much. </p>

<p>Generally, the extremities of Indy Hall are better areas for phone calls: the Workshop or the lounge on the 2nd floor, for example, tend to be just far enough away from the rest of the population to make for a calm calling experience. The center of the 2nd floor, the elevator lobby, is also a good place for a phone call.</p>

<p>If a conference room is unoccupied, feel free to use that space to take a call and pace around. </p>

<h2 id="2__What_should_I_do_if_someone_near_me_is_making_too_much_noise_">2. What should I do if someone near me is making too much noise?</h2>

<p>One of the features of Indy Hall is being surrounded by the constant hum and buzz of people getting things done. We love that, and so do many of our members. Of course, there's always a limit. If someone nearby is a little too loud, don't hesitate to speak up and let that person know - you're likely not the only one thinking that, and the noisy person might not realize that he's bothering someone. Be confident, be kind, be honest!</p>

<h2 id="3__How_do_I_reserve_a_conference_room_or_a_phone_booth_">3. How do I reserve a conference room or a phone booth?</h2>

<p>Need a conference room for a set time frame? Contact Karina or Adam by emailing info@indyhall.org, or find one of them in the hall. </p>

<p>The phone room is available to reserve though a sign-up board on the window. Make sure the date on the board is correct, write-in your name by the time(s) needed.</p>

<h2 id="4__How_do_I_work_the_thermostats_">4. How do I work the thermostats?</h2>

<p>Those pretty little Nest thermostats have a passcode on them! If you think a thermostat needs to be turned up or down, let Karina or Adam know and they can help out from there.</p>

<h2 id="5__What_kinds_of_things_should__and_shouldn_t__be_posted_to_GroupBuzz_">5. What kinds of things should (and shouldn't) be posted to GroupBuzz?</h2>

<p>GroupBuzz is our community discussion board, meant for general communication, community-wide inquiries, and sharing of events and information. The rule of thumb for what works best tends to be a personal, sincere, casual message. It's probably easier to mention posts that aren't successful or efficient: if it reads like a blog post, it likely won't be read well by members. Stay personal. Keep it real.</p>

<p>Job-listings are better suited to the "Gig Swap" room in Hall. Personal, one-to-one messages can create a lot of noise in in the discussion board.</p>

<h2 id="6__Can_I_get_packages_shipped_to_Indy_Hall_">6. Can I get packages shipped to Indy Hall?</h2>

<p>If you're here often enough to pick up your packages, sure! There is one absolutely vital rule associated with receiving any form of mail here at Indy Hall: you MUST pick-up your mail.</p>

<h2 id="7__Can_I_bring_a_my_own_desk_">7. Can I bring a my own desk?</h2>

<p>Actually, we're rather fond of our desks, and everyone uses the same style desk for a reason: it puts us all on the same playing field. After all, we're all here to play together - right? Our desks happen to be one of the few consistent elements here at Indy Hall, next to excellent people and awesome coffee, and we like to maintain that uniform foundation. </p>

<h2 id="8__Can_should_I_bring_my_own_chair_">8. Can/should I bring my own chair?</h2>

<p>If you have an officer chair that you fancy over Indy Hall's public stock, bring it in and use it! In fact, <strong>we strongly encourage</strong> Full-Time members to provide their own chair to free up those available to temporary members. Everything we said about the desk, above? Toss that right out when it comes to the chairs. BYOC!</p>

<h2 id="9__Can_I_switch_chairs_between_desks_">9. Can I switch chairs between desks?</h2>

<p>So long as you're not (permanently) borrowing a chair from a Full-Time member's desk, feel free to switch it up! Not feeling a particular chair and hoping to save someone else from the trouble? Let Adam or Karina know! </p>

<h2 id="10__How_often_should_I_change_where_I_sit_">10. How often should I change where I sit?</h2>

<p>You're free to change your desk and move around at any point of time. Moving your work station every so often is a stellar way to meet new people and form new relationships. Go ahead and get your nomad on!</p>

<p>Full-Timers: if we don't have any spare Full-Time desks available, don't hesitate to strike up a mutual migration with another Full-Timer at any time.</p>

<h2 id="11__Who_gets_to_keep_stuff_in_the_lockers_and_cubbies__How_long_can_I_keep_things_there_">11. Who gets to keep stuff in the lockers and cubbies? How long can I keep things there?</h2>

<p>Lockers and cubbies are readily available for use, but we like to keep the lockers only for daily storage. Similar to the refrigerator, we aim to make sure that nothing gets left behind, leaving as much space as possible available to share with all members. Feel free to use a locker for the day, but try not to leave anything overnight.  </p>

<h2 id="12__Do_I_need_to_reserve_conference_rooms__How_do_I_do_it_">12. Do I need to reserve conference rooms? How do I do it?</h2>

<p>If you're looking to grab a conference room for a certain span of time, you'll want to reserve the conference room ahead of time. While it's not required, it's an easy way to be sure that you won't be interrupted or be interrupting someone else. Chat with Adam or Karina in-person at Indy Hall, or drop them a line through info@indyhall.org. It's that easy!</p>

<p>If you need to grab a conference room for a hot minute and the room is vacant, go ahead and use it - no reservation needed. Just remember that someone may have the room booked soon after you've staked it out.</p>

<h2 id="13__There_are_a_lot_of_monitors_above_the_lockers__Are_those_for_general_use_">13. There are a lot of monitors above the lockers. Are those for general use?</h2>

<p>Ah, you've found the elephant graveyard of computer monitors. Monitors on the far right, closest to the stairs, are up for grabs to anyone at the hall. Please remember to return your monitor to its home above the lockers at the end of the day, before you leave.</p>

<h2 id="14__What_things_are_OK_to_do_with_the_Internet_connection__and_what_things_aren_t_">14. What things are OK to do with the Internet connection, and what things aren't?</h2>

<p>Yes: General web browsing. Small downloads. Skype.
No: Hosting files, bit torrent, huge downloads
Maybe (if the internet seems slow today, please turn these off): Dropbox sync, Video viewing, Google Drive sync</p>
