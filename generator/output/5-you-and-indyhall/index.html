<h1>What you already have in common</h1>

<p>The members [a.k.a. the people, coworkers, groups and community] of Indy Hall cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. <strong>We have a wider curiosity.</strong></p>

<p>We are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.</p>

<p>The participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.</p>

<p>We work to inspire anyone to help everyone. 
We use creative intelligence to solve real problems.</p>

<h2 id="1__Your_Responsibilities">1. Your Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Indy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are <strong>not</strong> a serviced office, and that's not an accident. </p>

<p>Being a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. In exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of you:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Participation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.</li>
<li>Your equipment &amp; professional liability is your responsibility.</li>
<li>Cleaning up after yourself, emptying bins &amp; recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. <strong>Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.</strong>
</li>
<li>Do leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).</li>
<li>Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.</li>
<li>Be responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.</li>
<li>Respect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. <strong>If you're not sure, ask them.</strong>
</li>
<li>The last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.</li>
</ul>
