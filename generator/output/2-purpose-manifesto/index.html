        <p>For Indy Hall, our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love.</p>
        
        <p>The Greeks had a word - eudaimonia - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as <em>"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Sound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.</strong></p>
        
        <p>At the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.</p>
        
        <p>We believe in sharing the good life &amp; actively working towards it together.</p>
        
        <p>Come pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!</p>
        
        <h3 id="1_1__How_we_do_it">1.1. How we do it</h3>
        
        <ul>
<li>
<p>We always:</p>
        
        <p>...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.<br>
        ...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.<br>
        ...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.<br>
        ...trust people to do the right thing.<br>
        ...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.<br>
        ...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   </p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>We never:</p>
        
        <p>...do anything against our community’s interest.<br>
        ...focus on desks or square footage.<br>
        ...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.<br>
        ...accept the status quo.<br>
        ...accept a "no" at face value.<br>
        ...compromise our core values.<br>
        ...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   </p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>Every day, we:</p>
        
        <p>...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.<br>
        ...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.<br>
        ...always look for a way to say yes.<br>
        ...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   </p>
</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
        <p>If we're more likely to <strong>succeed</strong> at our goals<br>
        when we work <strong>together</strong><br>
        why do we get so lost in the <em>"work"</em><br>
        that we forget about the <em>"together"</em>?   </p>
        
        <p>Does your success depend on more <em>transactions</em><br>
        or on more <em>meaningful relationships</em>?   </p>
        
        <p>Is a collaboration an opportunity to <strong>take</strong><br>
        or to <strong>give</strong>?   </p>
        
        <p>It turns out that relationships<br>
        are often the <strong>hardest</strong> work<br>
        out of all of our work   </p>
        
        <p>As we live our daily lives,<br>
        We <strong>hurry</strong>.<br>
        We <strong>react</strong>.<br>
        We <strong>protect ourselves</strong>.   </p>
        
        <p>While meaningful relationships depend on<br>
        patience<br>
        on curiosity<br>
        and on trust,   </p>
        
        <p>Our work by itself<br>
        doesn't provide us enough "space"<br>
        to <strong>be</strong> patient<br>
        or <strong>be</strong> curious<br>
        or <strong>be</strong> trusting.   </p>
        
        <p>So if we want success in our work,<br>
        and success comes from relationships<br>
        we have to make that "space" for ourselves.   </p>
        
        <p>It's not always easy to do<br>
        or obvious how to do it<br>
        but we're learning what makes a difference.   </p>
        
        <p>We focus on<br>
        the <strong>smallest interactions</strong><br>
        the <strong>unlikeliest connections</strong><br>
        and the <strong>simplest improvements that will benefit the culture of the group.</strong>   </p>
        
        <p>We take time to keep each other in mind<br>
        with every action<br>
        every interaction<br>
        and every decision.   </p>
        
        <p>And we <strong>trust each other</strong><br>
        to do the right thing.   </p>
        
        <p>When we <strong>consider relationships our priority</strong><br>
        all of our successes follow.   </p>
        
        <p>And that's when we transform<br>
        from a <em>group of people</em><br>
        into a <em>community</em>.    </p>
        
        <p><strong>Indy Hall. You're a part of it.</strong></p>
