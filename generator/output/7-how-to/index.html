<h1>How To Indy Hall</h1>

<h2 id="1__Getting_Started">1. Getting Started</h2>

<h3>How do I connect to the wireless network?</h3>

<p><img src="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/snaps/_20130723_194336.jpg" class="photo-right"></p>

<p>Use the wireless connections named "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" and "Indy Hall 5gHz". </p>

<p>All of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if youâ€™re having trouble connecting.</p>

<h4>What's the difference between the two networks available?</h4>

<p>Mobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticeably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Ask a neighbor</h4>

<p>Join the "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" network if you're not sure, and ask <em>anyone</em> for the password.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Where can I sit? Can/should I sit with people who do the same kind of work as me?</h3>

<blockquote>
<h4>Important note #1:</h4>

<p>Hopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! </p>

<h4>Important note #2:</h4>

<p>Choosing a place to sit is <strong>NOT</strong> permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a "reset" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like! We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo of Full Time Desk, set up with someone at it"></p>

<p><em>Full-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk</em> to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be "yours".</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo collage of the different flex areas with people at them"></p>

<p>If you're a <em>Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member</em>, if you're just <em>dropping in for the day</em>, or if you're a <em>Full-Time member who likes to change things up</em> more often, you can use any of the unoccupied <em>light-colored work surfaces</em> at Indy Hall. </p>

<p>Light-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!</p>

<p><strong>If you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>If you're a Full-Time member</em>, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!</p></li>
<li><p><em>And if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day,</em> you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo of people working on the couches"></p>

<p>Don't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace!</p>
