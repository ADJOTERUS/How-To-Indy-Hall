<h1>How To Indy Hall</h1>

<h2 id="1__Getting_Started">1. Getting Started</h2>

<h3>How do I connect to the wireless network?</h3>

<p><img src="http://dangerouslyawesome.com/snaps/_20130723_194336.jpg" class="photo-right"></p>

<p>Use the wireless connections named "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" and "Indy Hall 5gHz". </p>

<p>All of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if youâ€™re having trouble connecting.</p>

<h4>What's the difference between the two networks available?</h4>

<p>Mobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticeably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Ask a neighbor</h4>

<p>Join the "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" network if you're not sure, and ask <em>anyone</em> for the password.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Where can I sit? Can/should I sit with people who do the same kind of work as me?</h3>

<blockquote>
<h4>Important note #1</h4>

<p>Hopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Important note #2</h4>

<p>Choosing a place to sit is <strong>NOT</strong> permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a "reset" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>With these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like!</strong> We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo of Full Time Desk, set up with someone at it"></p>

<h4>For Full Time Members:</h4>

<p><em>Full-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk</em> to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be "yours".</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo collage of the different flex areas with people at them"></p>

<h4>For Everybody:</h4>

<p>If you're a <em>Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member</em>, if you're just <em>dropping in for the day</em>, or if you're a <em>Full-Time member who likes to change things up</em> more often, you can use any of the unoccupied <em>light-colored work surfaces</em> at Indy Hall. </p>

<p>Light-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>If you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:</h4>

<p><em>If you're a Full-Time member</em>, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!</p>

<p><em>And if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day,</em> you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Couch-working is a-okay here!</h4>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Photo of people working on the couches"></p>

<p>Don't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace!</p>

<h3>Where do Indy Hall members like to get lunch?</h3>

<p>Especially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Community Tip - Three's Company (and that's a good thing)</h4>

<p>Sometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), <strong>try going to lunch as a group of 3</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:</p>

<p><img src="http://placehold.it/600x350" alt="TODO Map of favorite spots"></p>

<h4>If you're in a hurry</h4>

<p>Some favorite quick options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. </p>

<h4>If you prefer to sit down</h4>

<p>For a less hurried meal, or planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. </p>

<p>Other popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. </p>

<h4>Where can I buy groceries?</h4>

<p>We're (sadly) missing a grocery store in Old City :( Nobody's perfect, eh?</p>

<h2 id="3__Parking___Public_Transport">3. Parking &amp; Public Transport</h2>

<h3>How can I get to Indy Hall by Public Transportation?</h3>

<p>TODO: Research all Septa lines that run near here.</p>

<h3>Where can I park my bike?</h3>

<p>TODO: Write help article about bike parking.</p>

<h3>Where's a good place to park my car near Indy Hall?</h3>

<p>Old City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, <strong>just make sure you read signs carefully</strong> and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says "Pay at Kiosk", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. </p>

<blockquote>
<h4>IMPORTANT:</h4>

<p>The left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested "loops" to drive to find free on-street parking: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yB9avVkI1N3dcAgpFSjV8Yx9Ni3L72Y2BXod-J9yPmo/pub">Community Powered Parking Tips</a></p>
