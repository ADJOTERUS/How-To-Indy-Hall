        <h1>Our Virtues</h1>
        
        <h2 id="1__Eudaimonia">1. Eudaimonia</h2>
        
        <p>The Greeks had a word - <strong>eudaimonia</strong> - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="2__Ar_te">2. Arête</h2>
        
        <p>The Greeks had another word - <strong>Arête</strong> - which translates into "virtues".</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Virtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the "side effect" of eudaimonia. </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>But virtues don’t automatically result in "the good life."</strong></p>
        
        <p>Think of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you’re likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn’t show up as fast as you want.</p>
        
        <p>If you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators come from deeper inside of you, and you’re more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.</p>
        
        <p>Weight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. <strong>The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Practicing Arête requires a transformation in perspective:</h4>
        
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
<li>From vision to ambition.</li>
        <li>From mission to intention.</li>
        <li>From strategy to constraints.</li>
        <li>From objectives to imperatives.</li>
        </ul>
</blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="3__Our_Ambition">3. Our Ambition</h2>
        
        <p>An <strong>ambition</strong> replaces a "vision" – and it answers the question "why are we here?" </p>
        
        <p>More specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. </p>
        
        <p>We earn bonus points for <strong>better</strong>, rather than bigger.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people <strong>before</strong> they need to work together.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="4__Our_Intentions">4. Our Intentions</h2>
        
        <p>An <strong>intention</strong> is an action required to achieve an ambition. </p>
        
        <p>How do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled? We seek to:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.<br>
        ...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.<br>
        ...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.<br>
        ...trust people to do the right thing.<br>
        ...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.<br>
        ...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="5__Our_Constraints">5. Our Constraints</h2>
        
        <p>Constraints are the actions which must <strong>not</strong> be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created. We must never:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>...do anything against our community’s interest.<br>
        ...focus on desks or square footage.<br>
        ...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.<br>
        ...accept the status quo.<br>
        ...accept a "no" at face value.<br>
        ...compromise our core values.<br>
        ...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 id="6__Our_Imperatives">6. Our Imperatives</h2>
        
        <p>Imperatives are the things that must be done daily. They’re specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions. We must always:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.<br>
        ...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.<br>
        ...always look for a way to say "yes".<br>
        ...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h4>Do It Yourself</h4>
        
        <p>If you’re running a business, from startup to Fortune 500, you can practice Arête.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.</p>
        
        <p>If your goals include doing things that are authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?</strong></p>
