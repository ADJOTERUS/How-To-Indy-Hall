<h1>Part 3 - Using the Kitchen</h1>

<h2 id="1__Can_I_keep_stuff_in_the_fridge_overnight_">1. Can I keep stuff in the fridge overnight?</h2>

<p>Here's the skinny: having a place to store perishables is pretty rad. Keeping your sandwich and iced tea cool is awesome. Sharing that space with a community of 200+ people is the opposite of rad. As a rule, we encourage members to only use the fridge for daily use. When Indy Haller is storing his/her week's meals in the same place, things get...messy. </p>

<p>Please be considerate of Indy Hall members, try not to leave items in the fridge overnight. </p>

<h2 id="2__Can_I_take_a_beer_from_the_beer_fridge_">2. Can I take a beer from the beer fridge?</h2>

<p>Our beer supply lives and dies by the mantra of TOLO: Take One, Leave One.</p>

<p>We like to share, here. The bottles in the beer fridge aren't the result of immaculate fermentation (though that would be a wonderfully lucrative business), and they were contributed by a thoughtful member. Enjoy the suds now, but don't forget to pay it forward for the next person</p>

<h2 id="3__So__where_can_I_pick_up_a_fresh_6_pack_to_restock_the_beer_fridge_">3. So, where can I pick up a fresh 6 pack to restock the beer fridge?</h2>

<h2 id="4__The_counters_look_messy___should_I_wipe_them_down_">4. The counters look messy - should I wipe them down?</h2>

<p>That would be really great - thanks! There are paper towels on the counter and Method cleaning spray under the sink. No paper towels nor cleaning spray? Check the Supply Closet. </p>

<h2 id="5__The_dishwasher_is_dirty__how_do_I_run_it_">5. The dishwasher is dirty, how do I run it?</h2>

<p>The dishwasher tablets are under the sink. Grab a tablet and put it in the dishwasher cup, located on the inside of the door. Lock the cup door and close the dishwasher door and press "on". Lastly, change the sign to "clean". Voila!</p>

<h2 id="6__The_dishwasher_is_clean__how_do_I_empty_it_">6. The dishwasher is clean, how do I empty it?</h2>

<p>The kitchen is mostly labeled for where you can find things and where you can put them away.  Grab the clean items and put them away. Don't be shy to ask for help and make sure to change the sign to "dirty" after.   </p>

<h2 id="7__How_can_I_know_if_the_dishwasher_currently_holds_dirty_or_clean_dishes_">7. How can I know if the dishwasher currently holds dirty or clean dishes?</h2>

<p>The sign on the dishwasher should indicate the status of the dishes. If you're leery, pop the dishwasher open and check the inside of any mug - if you see coffee or other non-clear liquids, it ain't clean.</p>

<h2 id="8__The_trash_can_in_the_kitchen_is_full__What_do_I_do_">8. The trash can in the kitchen is full. What do I do?</h2>

<p>Take it out, please. Clean trash bags are located next to the coffee maker, on the floor, in a white box. The loaded trash goes behind the fake wall downstairs. To get there, you go through two doors in the back of Indy Hall downstairs. If it is locked, grab either Adam or Karina.</p>
