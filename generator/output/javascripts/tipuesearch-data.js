More specifically, they described the good life as \"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\nSound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.\n\nAt the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.\n\nWe believe in sharing the good life & actively working towards it together.\n\nCome pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!\n\nHow we do it\n\nWe always:\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \nWe never:\n\n...do anything against our community’s interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \nEvery day, we:\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say yes.\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \nManifesto\n\n\nIf we're more likely to succeed at our goals\nwhen we work together\nwhy do we get so lost in the \"work\"\nthat we forget about the \"together\"?   \n\nDoes your success depend on more transactions\nor on more meaningful relationships?   \n\nIs a collaboration an opportunity to take\nor to give?   \n\nIt turns out that relationships\nare often the hardest work\nout of all of our work   \n\nAs we live our daily lives,\nWe hurry.\nWe react.\nWe protect ourselves.   \n\nWhile meaningful relationships depend on\npatience\non curiosity\nand on trust,   \n\nOur work by itself\ndoesn't provide us enough \"space\"\nto be patient\nor be curious\nor be trusting.   \n\nSo if we want success in our work,\nand success comes from relationships\nwe have to make that \"space\" for ourselves.   \n\nIt's not always easy to do\nor obvious how to do it\nbut we're learning what makes a difference.   \n\nWe focus on\nthe smallest interactions\nthe unlikeliest connections\nand the simplest improvements that will benefit the culture of the group.   \n\nWe take time to keep each other in mind\nwith every action\nevery interaction\nand every decision.   \n\nAnd we trust each other\nto do the right thing.   \n\nWhen we consider relationships our priority\nall of our successes follow.   \n\nAnd that's when we transform\nfrom a group of people\ninto a community.    \n\nIndy Hall. You're a part of it.\n","tags":"","loc":"/2-purpose-manifesto/"},{"title":null,"text":"Part 1 - Getting Started\n\nThe members [a.k.a. the people, coworkers, groups and community] of Indy Hall cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. We have a wider curiosity.\n\nWe are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.\n\nThe participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.\n\nWe work to inspiring anyone to help everyone. \nWe use creative intelligence to solve real problems.\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nIndy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. We're not a serviced office. In order to keep things ticking over nicely here are some essentials we ask everyone to be mindful of when using the space.\n\nParticipation is an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.\nYour equipment & professional liability is your responsibility (our insurance cannot cover it).\nCleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes. \nDo leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).\nAnyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.\nBe responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.\nRespect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not sure, ask them. \nThe last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.\nHow do I connect to the wireless network? What's the difference between the two networks available?\n\nYou can access our the internet from anywhere in the building, using connections named \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" and \"Indy Hall 5gHz\". \n\nMobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.\n\nAll of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if you’re having trouble connecting.\n\nShort Version: Join the \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" network if you're not sure, and ask anyone for the password.\n\nWhere can I sit? Can/should I sit with people who do the same kind of work as me?\n\nImportant note #1: Hopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! \n\nImportant note #2: choosing a place to sit is NOT permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a \"reset\" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. \n\nWith these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like! We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!\n\n\n\nFull-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be \"yours\".\n\n\n\nIf you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, or if you're a Full-Time member who likes to change things up more often, you can use any of the unoccupied light-colored work surfaces at Indy Hall. \n\nLight-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!\n\nIf you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:   \n\nIf you're a Full-Time member, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!\nAnd if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!\n\n\nDon't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace! \n\nWhere do Indy Hall members like to get lunch?\n\nEspecially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. \n\nPro tip: sometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), try going to lunch as a group of 3!\n\nFor choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:\n\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry - some favorite options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. \nIf you prefer to sit down - for a meal or are planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. \nOther popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. We're (sadly) missing a grocery store in Old City :( Nobody's perfect, eh?\n\nWhat are some tips for meeting other members?\n\nTip #1: RIGHT NOW, introduce yourself online!\n\nHave you accepted your invitations to our discussion list on GroupBuzz and our chat rooms on Hall.com? GroupBuzz is our online forum and email discussion list, while Hall.com gives you access to a collection of chat rooms occupied (and created by!) by Indy Hall members. \n\nLog in, spend a few minutes reading some of the existing discussions to get a feel, and then introduce yourself! Say a bit about what why you joined Indy Hall, what things you're interested in (don't limit yourself to work topics, people love sharing personal interests and hobbies, too). \n\nNote: Can't find your invite, or don't remember your login? Email help@indyhall.org and we'll get you fixed up!\n\nTip #2: Any time you're physically at Indy Hall, introduce yourself to a person you've never met before!\n\nEspecially when you're new, Indy Hall can be a lot to take in, and it's not always obvious where to start. \n\nIf you're overwhelmed, remember, you don't have to meet everybody at once. Stay focused on meeting one or two people at a time. \n\nWhen you sit down next to people you don't know, make eye contact and say hi, give them your name and ask for theirs. You can ask questions like, \"how long have you been a member?\" or \"Any tips for a newbie like me?\". Everyone here is interesting and loves sharing! \n\nBe patient. Be curious. Be friendly. Be honest.\n\nTip #3: Meet members at events\n\nThere are things to do with other Indy Hall members Indy Hall every week, including Working @ Night Owls & Dinner Club, joining in the conversation at Member Lunches, and Indy Hall Running Club, and B-Team trips to the comic book shop.   \n\nMonthly events include our ever-popular Show & Tell, various art openings, and happy hours. Over the course of the year, we also host several large parties that are open to the public. We're always looking for something to celebrate!   \n\nYou can find out about our planned event schedule by joining our Meetup Group: http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/\nYou don't have to wait for an event to show up on the calendar. Every day at Indy Hall can be an event! \n\nBecause they're not on the calendar, you do need to keep your eyes open for improtpu gatherings in the kitchen, lounge, gallery, and other common areas. Also, keep an eye on GroupBuzz discussions & Hall chat for announcements. \n\nHave an idea for getting members together? Awesome! If this is your first time getting members at Indy Hall organized...read below for some tips on how to be a kick ass community member. \nHow can I be a kick ass community member?\n\nBeing a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. Trust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.\n\nHere's are some observations for consideration:\n\nIn order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. \nIn order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.\nBeing vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources\nThe difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.\nSo with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. \n\nIf a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.\n\nTry framing it this way: instead of trying to help the \"members of Indy Hall\", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.\n\nWhere's a good place to park my car near Indy Hall?\n\nOld City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, just make sure you read signs carefully and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says \"Pay at Kiosk\", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. \n\nImportant Note: The left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.\n\nIndy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested \"loops\" to drive to find free on-street parking: Community Powered Parking Tips\n\nWhere are the exits? Are there any special emergency exits?\n\nDuring normal operations, all members and guests should enter and exit from the front door at 22 N. 3rd Street. Using the elevator or the balcony stairs for non-emergency usage can be a security risk for Indy Hall members, so please, please, please, don't use them. \n\nIn the case of an emergency, you can exit the 2nd floor by follow the red doors near the 3rd Street windows and take the stairs down from the balcony. The ground floor emergency exits are at the rear of the ground floor. Take the stairs down to the basement and follow the emergency exit signs to exit through the back of the building. \n\n","tags":"","loc":"/3-getting-started/"},{"title":null,"text":"Part 2 - Help out with the \"little things\"\n\nWe'll just come right out and say it: Indy Hall is not a \"serviced office\", we're a community office. This means that if you don't clean up after yourself, you're harming the experience of other members. Sharing resources allows for amazing things to happen, but it also means that we need to take care of the things that we share. \n\nIndy Hall runs best when everyone follows three simple guidelines: \n\nLook after yourself. \nLook after each other. \nLook after this place.\nHere's a few simple \"how to's\" that can help you take care of the place that we share. \n\nWhat should I do if I drink the last cup of coffee?\n\nImagine that you approach the coffee pot, place your cup underneath the spout, press down, and...drip drip drip. Damn. What HEATHEN would drink the last cup and not start up a fresh pot?!\n\nOkay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But only a little.\n\nMany members enjoy the rite of passage that comes with learning to make coffee at Indy Hall. Learning how to replenish the coffee is one of the best ways to connect with someone new at the hall, and it's a stellar way to let members know that you care about their caffiene-controlled sanity.\n\nThe big machine in the kitchen might look intimidating, but making coffee at Indy Hall is really easy, but don't hesitate to ask for help! Having another member guide you through making your first pot of coffee is an easy way to make a new friend. Most members sitting in close proximity to the kitchen know what's what, when it comes to the coffee machine, or you can ask for a lesson using GroupBuzz or Hall.\n\nFor you self-starters, here's a guide\n\nHold the clear container up and under the big red grinder's nozzle, making sure the container pushes gently on the trigger that allows the machine to start grinding.\n\nIf the grinder runs out of beans, we keep a stock under the coffee maker (right-hand side). Notice us running low on reserves? Email help@indyhall.org so we can place an order\n\n\nFill grounds up to the denoted line on the container - any more than that and we'll be bonding with members while clearning an awful coffee explosion.\n\n\nPlace a single filter into the filter basket. \n\nIf the old filter basket has used grounds in it, you can dump those into the composting can.\n\n\nPour the grounds into the filter, and slide the filter basket back into the machine. Make sure it's secure!\n\n\nPress the \"Start\" toggle button, and listen for the gratifying \"woosh\" as the water begins to flow.\n\n\nThe toilet paper roll is getting low. Where do we keep the toilet paper?\n\nFirst of all, good lookin' out! One of the more subtle, though absolutely critical ways we take care of each other is making sure that no one gets screwed over in terms of necessary resources being available. Trust me: EVERYONE appreciates the person who restocks the TP. \n\nThe Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if I use the last paper towel?\n\nLike the TP, you can be everyone's hero and replace an empty paper towel roll with a full one.\n\nThe Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if the soap dispenser is running low or empty?\n\nNo one wants to shake the hand of the guy who can't lather up after using the restroom. Help that guy out and grab some soap from the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor.\n\nThe Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do if we're running low (or run out of) coffee creamer/sugar?\n\nThanks for catching that. Drop an email to help@indyhall.org and we'll stock up.\n\nCan't wait, and want to take action? Lake Blue (3rd & Market, with the blue awning) sells both cream and sugar, just bring us a receipt and we'll credit your membership account.","tags":"","loc":"/4-running-smoothly/"},{"title":null,"text":"Part 4 - Sharing the Workspace\n\nI need to make a phone call, am I going to bother somebody?\n\nDon't worry, you're not the only person here who wants/needs to use the phone from time to time. Fortunately, just about everyone here has expressed the same concern of him/herself -  we're all cognizant of one another, when it comes to our own phone conversations. \n\nPhone calls are best taken in the phone room on the 2nd floor by the kitchen. You're the best judge of how much noise you're going to make during a phone call. Casual client conversations are easy to manage at your pod. Angry shouting matches with your telecom services, not so much. \n\nGenerally, the extremities of Indy Hall are better areas for phone calls: the Workshop or the lounge on the 2nd floor, for example, tend to be just far enough away from the rest of the population to make for a calm calling experience. The center of the 2nd floor, the elevator lobby, is also a good place for a phone call.\n\nIf a conference room is unoccupied, feel free to use that space to take a call and pace around. \n\nWhat should I do if someone near me is making too much noise?\n\nOne of the features of Indy Hall is being surrounded by the constant hum and buzz of people getting things done. We love that, and so do many of our members. Of course, there's always a limit. If someone nearby is a little too loud, don't hesitate to speak up and let that person know - you're likely not the only one thinking that, and the noisy person might not realize that he's bothering someone. Be confident, be kind, be honest!\n\nHow do I reserve a conference room or a phone booth?\n\nNeed a conference room for a set time frame? Contact Karina or Adam by emailing info@indyhall.org, or find one of them in the hall. \n\nThe phone room is available to reserve though a sign-up board on the window. Make sure the date on the board is correct, write-in your name by the time(s) needed.\n\nHow do I work the thermostats?\n\nThose pretty little Nest thermostats have a passcode on them! If you think a thermostat needs to be turned up or down, let Karina or Adam know and they can help out from there.\n\nWhat kinds of things should (and shouldn't) be posted to GroupBuzz?\n\nGroupBuzz is our community discussion board, meant for general communication, community-wide inquiries, and sharing of events and information. The rule of thumb for what works best tends to be a personal, sincere, casual message. It's probably easier to mention posts that aren't successful or efficient: if it reads like a blog post, it likely won't be read well by members. Stay personal. Keep it real.\n\nJob-listings are better suited to the \"Gig Swap\" room in Hall. Personal, one-to-one messages can create a lot of noise in in the discussion board.\n\nCan I get packages shipped to Indy Hall?\n\nIf you're here often enough to pick up your packages, sure! There is one absolutely vital rule associated with receiving any form of mail here at Indy Hall: you MUST pick-up your mail.\n\nCan I bring a my own desk?\n\nActually, we're rather fond of our desks, and everyone uses the same style desk for a reason: it puts us all on the same playing field. After all, we're all here to play together - right? Our desks happen to be one of the few consistent elements here at Indy Hall, next to excellent people and awesome coffee, and we like to maintain that uniform foundation. \n\nCan/should I bring my own chair?\n\nIf you have an officer chair that you fancy over Indy Hall's public stock, bring it in and use it! In fact, we strongly encourage Full-Time members to provide their own chair to free up those available to temporary members. Everything we said about the desk, above? Toss that right out when it comes to the chairs. BYOC!\n\nCan I switch chairs between desks?\n\nSo long as you're not (permanently) borrowing a chair from a Full-Time member's desk, feel free to switch it up! Not feeling a particular chair and hoping to save someone else from the trouble? Let Adam or Karina know! \n\nHow often should I change where I sit?\n\nYou're free to change your desk and move around at any point of time. Moving your work station every so often is a stellar way to meet new people and form new relationships. Go ahead and get your nomad on!\n\nFull-Timers: if we don't have any spare Full-Time desks available, don't hesitate to strike up a mutual migration with another Full-Timer at any time.\n\nWho gets to keep stuff in the lockers and cubbies? How long can I keep things there?\n\nLockers and cubbies are readily available for use, but we like to keep the lockers only for daily storage. Similar to the refrigerator, we aim to make sure that nothing gets left behind, leaving as much space as possible available to share with all members. Feel free to use a locker for the day, but try not to leave anything overnight.  \n\nDo I need to reserve conference rooms? How do I do it?\n\nIf you're looking to grab a conference room for a certain span of time, you'll want to reserve the conference room ahead of time. While it's not required, it's an easy way to be sure that you won't be interrupted or be interrupting someone else. Chat with Adam or Karina in-person at Indy Hall, or drop them a line through info@indyhall.org. It's that easy!\n\nIf you need to grab a conference room for a hot minute and the room is vacant, go ahead and use it - no reservation needed. Just remember that someone may have the room booked soon after you've staked it out.\n\nThere are a lot of monitors above the lockers. Are those for general use?\n\nAh, you've found the elephant graveyard of computer monitors. Monitors on the far right, closest to the stairs, are up for grabs to anyone at the hall. Please remember to return your monitor to its home above the lockers at the end of the day, before you leave.\n\nWhat things are OK to do with the Internet connection, and what things aren't?\n\nYes: General web browsing. Small downloads. Skype.\nNo: Hosting files, bit torrent, huge downloads\nMaybe (if the internet seems slow today, please turn these off): Dropbox sync, Video viewing, Google Drive sync","tags":"","loc":"/5-sharing-the-workspace/"},{"title":null,"text":"Part 3 - Using the Kitchen\n\nCan I keep stuff in the fridge overnight?\n\nHere's the skinny: having a place to store perishables is pretty rad. Keeping your sandwich and iced tea cool is awesome. Sharing that space with a community of 200+ people is the opposite of rad. As a rule, we encourage members to only use the fridge for daily use. When Indy Haller is storing his/her week's meals in the same place, things get...messy. \n\nPlease be considerate of Indy Hall members, try not to leave items in the fridge overnight. \n\nCan I take a beer from the beer fridge?\n\nOur beer supply lives and dies by the mantra of TOLO: Take One, Leave One.\n\nWe like to share, here. The bottles in the beer fridge aren't the result of immaculate fermentation (though that would be a wonderfully lucrative business), and they were contributed by a thoughtful member. Enjoy the suds now, but don't forget to pay it forward for the next person\n\nSo, where can I pick up a fresh 6 pack to restock the beer fridge?\n\nMulberry Market \n236 Arch St. Phila, PA 19106\n215-928-9064\n8 am to 11 pm Sun- Thurs; 8 am to 12 30 Fri - Sat\nBenjamin Franklin Beer Distributors \n27 S 2nd St. Phila, PA 19106 \n10 am to 10 pm Mon - Sun \n215-792-6330\nWine & Spirits for wine & spirits\n32 S 2nd St. Phila, PA 19106\n215-560-7062\n9 am to 9 pm Mon - Sat; Closed Sun\n\n\nThe counters look messy - should I wipe them down?\n\nThat would be really great - thanks! There are paper towels on the counter and Method cleaning spray under the sink. No paper towels nor cleaning spray? Check the Supply Closet. \n\nThe dishwasher is dirty, how do I run it?\n\nThe dishwasher tablets are under the sink. Grab a tablet and put it in the dishwasher cup, located on the inside of the door. Lock the cup door and close the dishwasher door and press \"on\". Lastly, change the sign to \"clean\". Voila!\n\nThe dishwasher is clean, how do I empty it?\n\nThe kitchen is mostly labeled for where you can find things and where you can put them away.  Grab the clean items and put them away. Don't be shy to ask for help and make sure to change the sign to \"dirty\" after.   \n\nHow can I know if the dishwasher currently holds dirty or clean dishes?\n\nThe sign on the dishwasher should indicate the status of the dishes. If you're leery, pop the dishwasher open and check the inside of any mug - if you see coffee or other non-clear liquids, it ain't clean.\n\nThe trash can in the kitchen is full. What do I do?\n\nTake it out, please. Clean trash bags are located next to the coffee maker, on the floor, in a white box. The loaded trash goes behind the fake wall downstairs. To get there, you go through two doors in the back of Indy Hall downstairs.
