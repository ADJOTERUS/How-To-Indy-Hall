More specifically, they described the good life as \"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\nSound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.\n\nAt the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.\n\nWe believe in sharing the good life & actively working towards it together.\n\nCome pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!\n\nHow we do it\n\nWe always:\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \nWe never:\n\n...do anything against our community’s interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \nEvery day, we:\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say yes.\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \nManifesto\n\n\nIf we're more likely to succeed at our goals\nwhen we work together\nwhy do we get so lost in the \"work\"\nthat we forget about the \"together\"?   \n\nDoes your success depend on more transactions\nor on more meaningful relationships?   \n\nIs a collaboration an opportunity to take\nor to give?   \n\nIt turns out that relationships\nare often the hardest work\nout of all of our work   \n\nAs we live our daily lives,\nWe hurry.\nWe react.\nWe protect ourselves.   \n\nWhile meaningful relationships depend on\npatience\non curiosity\nand on trust,   \n\nOur work by itself\ndoesn't provide us enough \"space\"\nto be patient\nor be curious\nor be trusting.   \n\nSo if we want success in our work,\nand success comes from relationships\nwe have to make that \"space\" for ourselves.   \n\nIt's not always easy to do\nor obvious how to do it\nbut we're learning what makes a difference.   \n\nWe focus on\nthe smallest interactions\nthe unlikeliest connections\nand the simplest improvements that will benefit the culture of the group.   \n\nWe take time to keep each other in mind\nwith every action\nevery interaction\nand every decision.   \n\nAnd we trust each other\nto do the right thing.   \n\nWhen we consider relationships our priority\nall of our successes follow.   \n\nAnd that's when we transform\nfrom a group of people\ninto a community.    \n\nIndy Hall. You're a part of it.\n","tags":"","loc":"/2-purpose-manifesto/"}]};
