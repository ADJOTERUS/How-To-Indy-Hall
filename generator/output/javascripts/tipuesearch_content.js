First and foremost, I want to thank you for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. When I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed of a place to work - it was because even through I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, I was lonely working by myself.\n\nMany years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.\n\nOne of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today is that the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.\n\nHow to use this Guide\n\nEven more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without written \"rulebook\" for our members. \n\nI've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because \"I like being able to change things as we go\". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we need to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that Our Virtues guide us away from). \n\nBut one of the other things that's allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading this thread on our discussion list, my eyes were opened to the need for more \"guidance systems\" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. \n\nA new kind of challenge\n\nSo creating this guide posed a new challenge: \n\n\nHow do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore of new possible answers?\n\n\nThe result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.\n\nThis is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.\n\nMost importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.\n\nIt's important remember to treat this as a map, and NOT a user manual. There are very few \"rules\", and always more than one way to skin a cat. \n\nYou're invited - and encouraged - to push boundaries, explore new options, find new (and better!) answers to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. \n\nYou can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on How To Contribute to this Guide to find out more.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Ideas?\n\nLet's keep the conversation going. \n\nIf you want to share with the entire community, start a new discussion on GroupBuzz. \n\nIf you prefer to start the conversation privately, you can email help@indyhall.org to reach Alex, Adam, and Karina directly.\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

More specifically, they described the good life as \n\n\n\"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\n\nVirtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the \"side effect\" of eudaimonia. \n\nThe virtues themselves don’t provide the good life, though.\n\nThink of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you’re likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn’t show up as fast as you want.\n\nIf you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators are come from deeper inside of you, and you’re more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.\n\nWeight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.\n\nIn order to practice Arête, it requires a transformation in perspective.\n\n\nFrom vision to ambition.\nFrom mission to intention.\nFrom strategy to constraints.\nFrom objectives to imperatives.\n\n\nOur Ambition\n\nAn ambition replaces a \"vision\" – and it answers the question \"why are we here?\" \n\nMore specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns you we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. \n\nWe earn bonus points for better, rather than bigger.\n\n\nOur ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people before they need to work together.\n\n\nOur Intentions\n\nAn intention is an action required to achieve an ambition. \n\nHow do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled?\n\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \n\n\nOur Constraints\n\nConstraints are the actions which must not be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created.\n\n\n...do anything against our community’s interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \n\n\nOur Imperatives\n\nImperatives are the things that must be done daily. They’re specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions.\n\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say yes.\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \n\n\nDo It Yourself\n\nIf you’re running a business, from startup to Fortune 50, you ca practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf your goals include doing things that authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.\n\nWhat are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?\n\n\nNote: the concepts and contents of this page originated in a post on Alex's Blog - The Virtues of Indy Hall.\n\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?
