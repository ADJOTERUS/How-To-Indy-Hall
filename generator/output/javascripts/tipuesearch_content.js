First and foremost, I want to thank you for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. When I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed a place to work - even though I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, I was lonely working by myself.\n\nMany years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.\n\nOne of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution, from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today, is that the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.\n\nHow to use this Guide\n\nEven more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without a written \"rulebook\" for our members. \n\nI've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because \"I like being able to change things as we go\". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we need to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that Our Virtues guide us away from). \n\nBut one of the other things that has allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading this thread on our discussion list, my eyes were opened to the need for more \"guidance systems\" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. \n\nA new kind of challenge\n\nSo creating this guide posed a new challenge: \n\n\nHow do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?\n\n\nThe result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.\n\nThis is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.\n\nMost importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.\n\nYou're invited - and encouraged - to push boundaries, explore new options, find new (and better!) answers to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. \n\nYou can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on How To Contribute to this Guide to find out more.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Ideas?\n\nLet's keep the conversation going. \n\nIf you want to share with the entire community, start a new discussion on GroupBuzz. \n\nIf you prefer to start the conversation privately, you can email help@indyhall.org to reach Alex, Adam, and Karina directly.\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

More specifically, they described the good life as \n\n\n\"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\n\nVirtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the \"side effect\" of eudaimonia. \n\nThe virtues themselves don’t provide the good life, though.\n\nThink of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you’re likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn’t show up as fast as you want.\n\nIf you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators are come from deeper inside of you, and you’re more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.\n\nWeight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.\n\nIn order to practice Arête, it requires a transformation in perspective.\n\n\nFrom vision to ambition.\nFrom mission to intention.\nFrom strategy to constraints.\nFrom objectives to imperatives.\n\n\nOur Ambition\n\nAn ambition replaces a \"vision\" – and it answers the question \"why are we here?\" \n\nMore specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns you we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. \n\nWe earn bonus points for better, rather than bigger.\n\n\nOur ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people before they need to work together.\n\n\nOur Intentions\n\nAn intention is an action required to achieve an ambition. \n\nHow do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled?\n\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \n\n\nOur Constraints\n\nConstraints are the actions which must not be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created.\n\n\n...do anything against our community’s interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \n\n\nOur Imperatives\n\nImperatives are the things that must be done daily. They’re specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions.\n\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say yes.\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \n\n\nDo It Yourself\n\nIf you’re running a business, from startup to Fortune 50, you ca practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf your goals include doing things that authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.\n\nWhat are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?\n\n\nNote: the concepts and contents of this page originated in a post on Alex's Blog - The Virtues of Indy Hall.\n\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

We have a wider curiosity.\n\nWe are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.\n\nThe participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.\n\nWe work to inspire anyone to help everyone. \nWe use creative intelligence to solve real problems.\n\nHow to be a kick ass community member\n\nBeing a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. \n\nTrust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.\n\nHere's an observation for consideration:\n\n\nIn order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. \nIn order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.\nBeing vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources\nThe difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.\n\n\nSo with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. \n\nIf a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.\n\nCommunity Tip - Start Small\n\nTry framing it this way: instead of trying to help the \"members of Indy Hall\", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nIndy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are not a serviced office, and that's not an accident. \n\nBeing a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. \n\nIn exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of you:\n\n\nParticipation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.\nYour equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.\nCleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.\nDo leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).\nAnyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.\nBe responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.\nRespect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not sure, ask them.\nThe last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.\n\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?
