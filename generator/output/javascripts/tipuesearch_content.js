First and foremost, I want to thank you for accepting our invitation to be a member of Indy Hall. \n\nWhen I started down the path of creating Indy Hall, it wasn't because I needed a place to work - even though I loved the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere, I was lonely working by myself. If you're here for similar reasons (and there's a good chance you are), we're already helping each other.\n\nMany years later, Indy Hall has evolved into an unusual, exceptional, unpredictable, and wonderful place - but you probably already know that, because you've made the decision to be a part of our community.\n\nOne of the things that's always been remarkable to me about Indy Hall's growth and evolution, from our initial 20 members to the 200+ member community we are today, is that the culture of this community is still as strong as it was the first day, if not stronger for our size.\n\nHow to use this Guide\n\nEven more remarkable is that we've accomplished this without a written \"rulebook\" for our members. \n\nI've often joked that part of the reason we don't have a rulebook is because \"I like being able to change things as we go\". There's more than a bit of truth in that, and in fact, I believe that we need to be able to change things as we go. Once we write down an answer, people tend to stop exploring new possibilities (accepting things as status quo is something that Our Virtues guide us away from). \n\nBut one of the other things that has allowed Indy Hall to evolve successfully is listening with an open mind. While reading this thread on our discussion list, my eyes were opened to the need for more \"guidance systems\" to help Indy Hall members feel comfortable and confident in our community. \n\nA new kind of challenge\n\nWhile creating this guide, we asked ourselves the question: \n\n\nHow do we create a resource that gives answers, but also explains how we came up with those answers and encourages members to explore new possible answers?\n\n\nThe result is a guide that is a mix of story, dialogue, introspection, ideas, and tools to help you be an excellent community member at Indy Hall - and ultimately, in any setting where you gather, meet, work, and collaborate.\n\nThis is a map, not a manual. We need your contributions.\n\nMost importantly, this guide is co-created by you - the members of Indy Hall.\n\nYou're invited - and encouraged - to push boundaries, explore new options, find new (and better!) answers to any questions about how to succeed as a member, and how to help this community succeed. \n\nYou can even contribute directly to the guide with additional/revised text, photos, stories, links, blog posts, etc. Read our how to section on How To Contribute to this Guide to find out more.\n\nMake It Better\n\nThis document isn't written in stone. While every line is there for a reason, every line is also an invitation to talk about it. We warmly welcome conversation, debate, and experimentation. \n\nIf you want to share with the entire community, start a new discussion on GroupBuzz. \n\nIf you prefer to start the conversation privately, you can email help@indyhall.org to reach Alex, Adam, and Karina directly.\n\nLook for TODOs\n\nTODO: Explain how to look for todo's.\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

More specifically, they described the good life as:\n\n\n\"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement.\"\n\n\nArête\n\nThe Greeks had another word - Arête - which translates into \"virtues\".\n\n\nVirtues are patterns in how we behave - habits, choices, interactions, etc - that when practiced and matured bring the \"side effect\" of eudaimonia. \n\n\nBut virtues don’t automatically result in \"the good life.\"\n\nThink of it like going to the gym: if you go to the gym to lose weight, you’re likely to be disappointed or fall off the wagon if the weight loss doesn’t show up as fast as you want.\n\nIf you go to the gym to be healthy, your motivators come from deeper inside of you, and you’re more likely to push through the harder parts of the workout routine as you make progress with becoming healthier.\n\nWeight loss will be the byproduct of becoming healthier. The good life is a byproduct of practicing Arête every day.\n\nPracticing Arête requires a transformation in perspective:\n\n\nFrom vision to ambition.\nFrom mission to intention.\nFrom strategy to constraints.\nFrom objectives to imperatives.\n\n\nOur Ambition\n\nAn ambition replaces a \"vision\" – and it answers the question \"why are we here?\" \n\nMore specifically, an ambition is meant to define the kinds of returns we will create, and who will benefit. The more genuine the value is, the greater the ambition. \n\nWe earn bonus points for better, rather than bigger.\n\n\nOur ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love, creating space for trusting, lasting relationships between people before they need to work together.\n\n\nOur Intentions\n\nAn intention is an action required to achieve an ambition. \n\nHow do you improve things for the people you interact with? What interactions make sure the ambition is being fulfilled? We seek to:\n\n\n...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.\n...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.\n...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.\n...trust people to do the right thing.\n...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.\n...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   \n\n\nOur Constraints\n\nConstraints are the actions which must not be done. Constraints exist to avoid things that do damage to the value being created. We must never:\n\n\n...do anything against our community’s interest.\n...focus on desks or square footage.\n...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.\n...accept the status quo.\n...accept a \"no\" at face value.\n...compromise our core values.\n...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   \n\n\nOur Imperatives\n\nImperatives are the things that must be done daily. They’re specific, focused actions that help achieve the intentions and ambitions. We must always:\n\n\n...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.\n...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.\n...always look for a way to say \"yes\".\n...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   \n\n\nDo It Yourself\n\nIf you’re running a business, from startup to Fortune 500, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re developing a community, from a family to a city, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re creating, from art to technology, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf you’re working, alone or as part of a team, you can practice Arête.\n\nIf your goals include doing things that are authentic and meaningful, you must practice Arête.\n\nWhat are your ambitions, intentions, constraints, and imperatives?\n\n\nNote: the concepts and contents of this page originated in a post on Alex's Blog - The Virtues of Indy Hall.\n\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

We have a wider curiosity.\n\nWe are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.\n\nThe participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.\n\nWe work to inspire anyone to help everyone. \nWe use creative intelligence to solve real problems.\n\nHow to be a kick ass community member\n\nBeing a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. \n\nTrust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.\n\nHere's an observation for consideration:\n\n\nIn order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. \nIn order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.\nBeing vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources\nThe difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.\n\n\nSo with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. \n\nIf a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Start Small\n\nTry framing it this way: instead of trying to help the \"members of Indy Hall\", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.\n\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nIndy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are not a serviced office, and that's not an accident. \n\nBeing a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. \n\nIn exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of all Indy Hall members, in taking care of each other:\n\n\nParticipation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.\nYour equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.\nCleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.\nDo leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).\nAnyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.\nBe responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.\nRespect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not sure, ask them.\nThe last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.\n\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?

GroupBuzz is our online forum and email discussion list, while Hall.com gives you access to a collection of chat rooms occupied (and created by!) by Indy Hall members. \n\n\nNote: Can't find your invite to Hall or GroupBuzz, or don't remember your login?

Be sure to use the same email address you get Indy Hall emails from.\nYou should also add a brief bio about yourself on the \"Profile\" page in GroupBuzz.\n\n\nHall.com (ask for an invite)\n\n\n\nLog in, spend a few minutes reading some of the existing discussions to get a feel, and then introduce yourself! Say a bit about what why you joined Indy Hall, what things you're interested in (don't limit yourself to work topics, people love sharing personal interests and hobbies, too). \n\n\nCommunity Tip - What to post (and what not to post)\n\nIt's probably easier to mention posts that aren't successful or efficient: if it reads like a blog post, it likely won't be read well by members. Stay personal. Keep it real.\n\nRemember the difference between asking a friend for help and posting a recruiting email. Job listings are best to the \"Gig Swap\" room in Hall. \n\n\nMeeting Members Offline\n\nEspecially when you're new, Indy Hall can be a lot to take in, and it's not always obvious where to start. \n\nIf you're overwhelmed, remember, you don't have to meet everybody at once. Stay focused on meeting one or two people at a time. \n\nWhen you sit down next to people you don't know, make eye contact and say hi, give them your name and ask for theirs. You can ask questions like, \"how long have you been a member?\" or \"Any tips for a newbie like me?\". \n\nEveryone here is interesting (even if they don't think so)! \n\nBe patient. Be curious. Be friendly. Be honest.\n\nMeeting Members at Events\n\nWeekly & Monthly Events\n\nThere are things to do with other Indy Hall members Indy Hall every week, including Working @ Night Owls & Dinner Club, joining in the conversation at Member Lunches, and Indy Hall Running Club, and B-Team trips to the comic book shop.   \n\nMonthly events include our ever-popular Show & Tell, various art openings, and happy hours. Over the course of the year, we also host several large parties that are open to the public. We're always looking for something to celebrate!   \n\nYou can find out about our planned event schedule by joining our Meetup Group: http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/\n\n\"Everyday\" and impromptu events\n\nYou don't have to wait for an event to show up on the calendar. Every day at Indy Hall can be an event! \n\nBecause they're not on the calendar, you do need to keep your eyes open for improtpu gatherings in the kitchen, lounge, gallery, and other common areas. Also, keep an eye on GroupBuzz discussions & Hall chat for announcements. \n\n\nHave an idea for getting members together? Awesome!

Get meta and check out the guide on contributing to to this guide!\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nConnecting to Wifi\n\n\n\nUse the wireless connections named \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" and \"Indy Hall 5gHz\". \n\nAll of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if you’re having trouble connecting.\n\nWhat's the difference between the two networks available?\n\nMobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticeably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Ask a neighbor\n\nJoin the \"Indy Hall 2.4gHz\" network if you're not sure, and ask anyone for the password.\n\n\nFinding a seat\n\n\nImportant note #1\n\nHopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! \n\nImportant note #2\n\nChoosing a place to sit is NOT permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a \"reset\" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. \n\n\nWith these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like! We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!\n\n\n\nFor Full Time Members:\n\nFull-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be \"yours\".\n\n\n\nFor Everybody:\n\nIf you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, or if you're a Full-Time member who likes to change things up more often, you can use any of the unoccupied light-colored work surfaces at Indy Hall. \n\nLight-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!\n\n\nIf you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:\n\nIf you're a Full-Time member, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!\n\nAnd if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day, you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!\n\n\nCouch-working is a-okay here!\n\n\n\nDon't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace!\n\nFood & Drink\n\nLunch & Dinner\n\nEspecially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Three's Company (and that's a good thing)\n\nSometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), try going to lunch as a group of 3!\n\n\nFor choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:\n\n\n\nIf you're in a hurry\n\nSome favorite quick options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. \n\nIf you prefer to sit down\n\nFor a less hurried meal, or planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. \n\nOther popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. \n\nHappy Hour\n\nTODO: Write section on Happy Hour\n\nBuying groceries\n\nWe're (sadly) missing a grocery store in Old City :( Nobody's perfect, eh?\n\nGetting Here\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nTODO: Research all Septa lines that run near here.\n\nBiking\n\nTODO: Write help article about bike parking.\n\nParking\n\nOld City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, just make sure you read signs carefully and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says \"Pay at Kiosk\", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. \n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nThe left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.\n\n\nIndy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested \"loops\" to drive to find free on-street parking: Community Powered Parking Tips\n\nCoworking\n\nMaking Reservations\n\nBringing Guests\n\nConference Rooms\n\nIf you're looking to grab a conference room for a certain span of time, you'll want to reserve the conference room ahead of time. While it's not required, it's an easy way to be sure that you won't be interrupted or be interrupting someone else. Chat with Adam or Karina in-person at Indy Hall, or drop them a line through info@indyhall.org. That's it!\n\nIf you need to grab a conference room for a hot minute and the room is vacant, go ahead and use it - no reservation needed. Just remember that someone may have the room booked soon after you've staked it out.\n\nThe phone booth is available to reserve though a sign-up board on the window. Make sure the date on the board is correct, write-in your name by the time(s) needed.\n\nPhone Calls\n\nDon't worry, you're not the only person here who wants/needs to use the phone from time to time. Fortunately, just about everyone here has expressed the same concern of him/herself -  we're all cognizant of one another, when it comes to our own phone conversations. \n\nPhone calls are best taken in the phone room on the 2nd floor by the kitchen. You're the best judge of how much noise you're going to make during a phone call. Casual client conversations are easy to manage at your pod. Angry shouting matches with your telecom services, not so much. \n\nGenerally, the extremities of Indy Hall are better areas for phone calls: the Workshop or the lounge on the 2nd floor, for example, tend to be just far enough away from the rest of the population to make for a calm calling experience. The center of the 2nd floor, the elevator lobby, is also a good place for a phone call.\n\nIf a conference room is unoccupied, feel free to use that space to take a call and pace around. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Noisy Neighbors\n\nOne of the built-in features of Indy Hall is being surrounded by the constant hum and buzz of people getting things done. We love that...to a limit.\n\nIf someone nearby is a little too loud, don't hesitate to speak up and let that person know - you're likely not the only one thinking that, and the noisy person might not realize that he's bothering someone. Be confident, be kind, be honest!\n\n\nWorkspace Questions\n\nCan I bring a my own desk?\n\nActually, we're rather fond of our desks, and everyone uses the same style desk for a reason: it puts us all on the same playing field. After all, we're all here to play together - right? Our desks happen to be one of the few consistent elements here at Indy Hall, next to excellent people and awesome coffee, and we like to maintain that uniform foundation. \n\nCan/should I bring my own chair?\n\nIf you have an officer chair that you fancy over Indy Hall's public stock, bring it in and use it! In fact, we strongly encourage Full-Time members to provide their own chair to free up those available to temporary members. Everything we said about the desk, above? Toss that right out when it comes to the chairs. BYOC!\n\nCan I switch chairs between desks?\n\nSo long as you're not (permanently) borrowing a chair from a Full-Time member's desk, feel free to switch it up! Not feeling a particular chair and hoping to save someone else from the trouble? Let Adam or Karina know!\n\nMail\n\nIf you would like to have mail/packages delivered to Indy Hall, please speak to one of the core team members about it first (drop an email to help@indyhall.org).\n\nThere is one absolutely vital rule associated with receiving any form of mail here at Indy Hall: you MUST pick-up your mail. \n\nPlease track your own packages so you know when to pick them up.\n\nLockers/Storage\n\nLockers and cubbies are readily available for use, but we like to keep the lockers only for daily storage. Similar to the refrigerator, we aim to make sure that nothing gets left behind, leaving as much space as possible available to share with all members. Feel free to use a locker for the day, but try not to leave anything overnight.  \n\nMonitors\n\nAh, you've found the elephant graveyard of computer monitors. Monitors on the far right, closest to the stairs, are up for grabs to anyone at the hall. Please remember to return your monitor to its home above the lockers at the end of the day, before you leave.\n\nInternet etiquette\n\nTODO: Write section on Internet Etiquette\n\nHeat & A/C\n\nIf you think the heat or A/C needs to be adjusted, first talk to the people near you about their comfort levels. If the group agrees that a temperature change would be more comfortable, let Karina or Adam know and they can help out from there.\n\nBathrooms\n\nTODO: Write section on bathrooms. \n\nIndy Hall has 4 (four) bathrooms:\n\nRefilling the soap dispenser.\n\nNo one wants to shake the hand of the member who can't lather up after using the restroom. Help the next person out and refill the soap.\n\nWe keep soap refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). \n\nReplacing/restocking the Toilet Paper\n\nOne of the more subtle, though absolutely critical ways we take care of each other is making sure that no one gets screwed over in terms of necessary resources being available. Trust me: EVERYONE appreciates the person who restocks the TP.\n\nWe keep TP refills in the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor (see below for location). \n\n\nCommunity Tip: Know Thy Supply Closet\n\nOur Supply Closet is located on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door! \n\n\n\nDoes it look like we're running low on reserves of anything? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\n\nEmergency Exits\n\nDuring normal operations, all members and guests should enter and exit from the front door at 22 N. 3rd Street. Using the elevator or the balcony stairs for non-emergency usage can be a security risk for Indy Hall members, so please, please, please, don't use them. \n\nIn the case of an emergency, you can exit the 2nd floor by follow the red doors near the 3rd Street windows and take the stairs down from the balcony. The ground floor emergency exits are at the rear of the ground floor. Take the stairs down to the basement and follow the emergency exit signs to exit through the back of the building. \n\n\n\nKitchen\n\nCoffee\n\nImagine that you approach the coffee pot, place your cup underneath the spout, press down, and...drip drip drip. \n\nDamn. What HEATHEN would drink the last cup and not start up a fresh pot?!\n\nOkay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But only a little.\n\nMany members enjoy the rite of passage that comes with making their first pot of coffee at Indy Hall. Making a fresh pot is an excellent way to let other members know that you care about their caffiene-controlled sanity.\n\nThe big machine in the kitchen might look intimidating, but making coffee at Indy Hall is really easy to learn. \n\n\nCommunity Tip - Ask for Coffee Coaching\n\nHaving another member guide you through the steps is an easy way to make a new friend. Most members sitting in close proximity to the kitchen know what's what, when it comes to the coffee machine, or you can ask for a lesson using GroupBuzz or Hall.\n\n\nFor you self-starters, here's a guide:\n\nHold the clear container up and under the big red grinder's nozzle, making sure the container pushes gently on the trigger that allows the machine to start grinding.\n\nIf the grinder runs out of beans, we keep a stock under the coffee maker (right-hand side). \n\n\n\nNotice us running low on reserves? Email help@indyhall.org so we can place an order.\nFill grounds up to the denoted line on the container - any more than that and we'll be bonding with members while clearning an awful coffee explosion.\n\n\nPlace a single filter into the filter basket. \n\n\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Composting is Cool\n\nIf the filter basket contains used grounds, you can dump the grounds and filter into the composting can to the left of the fridge. Just don't toss the plastic filter basket itself!\n\nPour the grounds into the filter, and slide the filter basket back into the machine. Make sure it's secure!\n\n\nPress the \"Start\" toggle button, and listen for the gratifying \"woosh\" as the water begins to flow.\n\n\n\nCommunity Tip - Eyes on the cream/sugar supplies\n\nWe do our best to keep the cream and sugar supply stocked. If you notice us running low, drop a line to help@indyhall.org and we'll stock up.\n\nIf you're feeling the JFDI spirit, Lake Blue (3rd & Market, with the blue awning) sells both cream and sugar, just bring us a receipt and we'll credit your membership account.\n\n\nUsing the Fridge\n\nHere's the skinny: having a place to store perishables is pretty rad. Keeping your sandwich and iced tea cool is awesome. Sharing that space with a community of 200+ people is the opposite of rad. As a rule, we encourage members to only use the fridge for daily use. When Indy Haller is storing his/her week's meals in the same place, things get...messy. \n\nPlease be considerate of Indy Hall members, try not to leave items in the fridge overnight. \n\nBeer Fridge/Keg\n\nOur beer supply lives and dies by the mantra of TOLO: Take One, Leave One.\n\nWe like to share, here. The bottles in the beer fridge aren't the result of immaculate fermentation (though that would be a wonderfully lucrative business), and they were contributed by a thoughtful member. Enjoy the suds now, but don't forget to pay it forward for the next person\n\nCleaning\n\nPaper Towels\n\nLike the TP, you can be everyone's hero by simply replacing an empty (or near empty) paper towel roll with a full one.\n\nThe Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.\n\nDishes (and the sink)\n\nTODO: Write intro for kitchen cleaning section.\n\nThe counters look messy - should I wipe them down?\n\nThat would be really great - thanks! There are paper towels on the counter and Method cleaning spray under the sink. No paper towels nor cleaning spray? Check the Supply Closet. \n\nThe dishwasher is dirty, how do I run it?\n\nThe dishwasher tablets are under the sink. Grab a tablet and put it in the dishwasher cup, located on the inside of the door. Lock the cup door and close the dishwasher door and press \"on\". Lastly, change the sign to \"clean\". Voila!\n\nThe dishwasher is clean, how do I empty it?\n\nThe kitchen is mostly labeled for where you can find things and where you can put them away.  Grab the clean items and put them away. Don't be shy to ask for help and make sure to change the sign to \"dirty\" after.   \n\nHow can I know if the dishwasher currently holds dirty or clean dishes?\n\nThe sign on the dishwasher should indicate the status of the dishes. If you're leery, pop the dishwasher open and check the inside of any mug - if you see coffee or other non-clear liquids, it ain't clean.\n\nThe trash can in the kitchen is full. What do I do?\n\nTake it out, please. Clean trash bags are located next to the coffee maker, on the floor, in a white box. The loaded trash goes behind the fake wall downstairs. To get there, you go through two doors in the back of Indy Hall downstairs. If it is locked, grab either Adam or Karina.\n\nWhat goes in the trash? What goes in the recycling? What goes in the composting?\n\nTODO: Trash stuff.\n\nContributing to this Guide\n\nTODO: Write instructions on how to contribute via email, or directly via github.\n\nAdd your voice\n\nWanna help make this page better?
