## Where can I fax?

In 1992. 

We do not have a fax machine at Indy Hall although our printer (Brother MFC-780DW-2) does scan and we can recommend [HelloFax](https://www.hellofax.com/) as a web-based fax service that is easy and allows for sending and receiving.

If that is not an option, the UPS Store provides faxing services
