# What you already have in common

The members [a.k.a. the people, coworkers, groups and community] of Indy Hall cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. **We have a wider curiosity.**

We are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.

The participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.

We work to inspire anyone to help everyone. 
We use creative intelligence to solve real problems.

## Your Responsibilities
Indy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. Among the differences, we are **not** a serviced office, and that's not an accident. 

Being a member of Indy Hall comes with the benefits of sharing ideas, information, support, and of course our coworking clubhouse. In exchange, here is a non-exhaustive  the expectations that we have of you:

> * Participation can be an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.
> * Your equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.
> * Cleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. **Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes.**
> * Do leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).
> * Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.
> * Be responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.
> * Respect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. **If you're not sure, ask them.**
> * The last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.
