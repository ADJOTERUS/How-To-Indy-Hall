# Manifesto

> If we're more likely to **succeed** at our goals    
> when we work **together**   
> why do we get so lost in the *"work"*   
> that we forget about the *"together"*?   
> 
> Does your success depend on more *transactions*   
> or on more *meaningful relationships*?   
> 
> Is a collaboration an opportunity to **take**   
> or to **give**?   
> 
> It turns out that relationships    
> are often the **hardest** work   
> out of all of our work   
> 
> As we live our daily lives,   
> We **hurry**.    
> We **react**.   
> We **protect ourselves**.   
> 
> While meaningful relationships depend on   
> patience   
> on curiosity   
> and on trust,   
> 
> Our work by itself   
> doesn't provide us enough "space"   
> to **be** patient   
> or **be** curious   
> or **be** trusting.   
> 
> So if we want success in our work,   
> and success comes from relationships   
> we have to make that "space" for ourselves.   
> 
> It's not always easy to do   
> or obvious how to do it   
> but we're learning what makes a difference.   
> 
> We focus on    
> the **smallest interactions**   
> the **unlikeliest connections**   
> and the **simplest improvements that will benefit the culture of the group.**   
> 
> We take time to keep each other in mind    
> with every action   
> every interaction   
> and every decision.   
> 
> And we **trust each other**   
> to do the right thing.   
> 
> When we **consider relationships our priority**   
> all of our successes follow.   
> 
> And that's when we transform    
> from a *group of people*   
> into a *community*.    
> 
> **Indy Hall. You're a part of it.**
