# Where to find the things you need

## Where can I get stamps? 

In addition to selling stamps, this location is both an operating post office (although no packages that weigh more than 13 oz and the customer service isn't always the best) **and** a museum!.

## Where can I fax?

Back in the 80s. Just kidding, [McFly](/assets/images/mcfly.jpg).

We do not have a fax machine at Indy Hall although our printer (Brother MFC-780DW-2) does scan and we can recommend [HelloFax](https://www.hellofax.com/) as a web-based fax service that is easy and allows for sending and receiving.

If that is not an option, the UPS Store provides faxing services
