## Our purpose, and who we are

For Indy Hall, our ambition is to make Philadelphia (and ultimately the world) a better place to make a living doing what you love.

The Greeks had a word - eudaimonia - which translates to "the good life". More specifically, they described the good life as *"...rich with relationships, ideas, emotion, health and vigor, recognition and contribution, passion and fulfillment, and great accomplishment and enduring achievement."*

**Sound appealing? Then Indy Hall might be for you.**

At the heart of Indy Hall, you'll find great people having authentic and meaningful experiences. We are living - and working - the good life.

We believe in sharing the good life & actively working towards it together.

Come pursue these goals with us, as a member of Indy Hall. We're excited to meet you!

### How we do it

* We always:

	...help unlikely groups of likeminded people form relationships.   
	...focus on people and their interactions, and the formation of relationships.   
	...help people tell the stories of the experiences they have in Philadelphia.   
	...trust people to do the right thing.   
	...guide people to being good citizens of Indy Hall and of Philadelphia.   
	...support people in their goals of building businesses to last, in Philadelphia and for Philadelphia.   

* We never:

	...do anything against our community’s interest.   
	...focus on desks or square footage.   
	...create something only because we think we’re supposed to.   
	...accept the status quo.   
	...accept a "no" at face value.   
	...compromise our core values.   
	...prioritize a transaction before a relationship.   

* Every day, we:

	...keep people at the center of every action, interaction, and decision.   
	...welcome new community members, and make it clear that Indy Hall is theirs, not just ours.   
	...always look for a way to say yes.   
	...teach others in our immediate and neighboring communities how we operate.   

## Manifesto

> If we're more likely to **succeed** at our goals    
> when we work **together**   
> why do we get so lost in the *"work"*   
> that we forget about the *"together"*?   
> 
> Does your success depend on more *transactions*   
> or on more *meaningful relationships*?   
> 
> Is a collaboration an opportunity to **take**   
> or to **give**?   
> 
> It turns out that relationships    
> are often the **hardest** work   
> out of all of our work   
> 
> As we live our daily lives,   
> We **hurry**.    
> We **react**.   
> We **protect ourselves**.   
> 
> While meaningful relationships depend on   
> patience   
> on curiosity   
> and on trust,   
> 
> Our work by itself   
> doesn't provide us enough "space"   
> to **be** patient   
> or **be** curious   
> or **be** trusting.   
> 
> So if we want success in our work,   
> and success comes from relationships   
> we have to make that "space" for ourselves.   
> 
> It's not always easy to do   
> or obvious how to do it   
> but we're learning what makes a difference.   
> 
> We focus on    
> the **smallest interactions**   
> the **unlikeliest connections**   
> and the **simplest improvements that will benefit the culture of the group.**   
> 
> We take time to keep each other in mind    
> with every action   
> every interaction   
> and every decision.   
> 
> And we **trust each other**   
> to do the right thing.   
> 
> When we **consider relationships our priority**   
> all of our successes follow.   
> 
> And that's when we transform    
> from a *group of people*   
> into a *community*.    
> 
> **Indy Hall. You're a part of it.**
