# Part 1 - Getting Started

The members [a.k.a. the people, coworkers, groups and community] of Indy Hall cannot be pigeon holed by job titles or industry sectors. We have a wider curiosity.

We are a gathering of people finding a way of working better together (both offline and on) focused on inspiration, participation and learning through doing. Anything can happen, the environments and space(s) change.

The participants of Indy Hall share a fundamental optimism, a spirit of liberty in action, encouragement and enlightenment. Where many people would see problems, Participants see opportunities for making things better, and they wish to take on a personal responsibility for making things happen.

We work to inspiring anyone to help everyone. 
We use creative intelligence to solve real problems.

## Your Responsibilities
Indy Hall is quite different from your average working environment. We're not a serviced office. In order to keep things ticking over nicely here are some essentials we ask everyone to be mindful of when using the space.

* Participation is an extreme sport. If you break or lose it, you should replace it.
* Your equipment & professional liability is your responsibility (our insurance cannot cover it).
* Cleaning up after yourself, emptying bins & recycling when they are full is a shared responsibility. We work together to keep the space we're proud of presentable. Let a core team member know if you're not sure where empty bags are, or where trash goes. 
* Do leave the spaces as you found them, or better than you found them (artwork and decoration is welcome).
* Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked to leave.
* Be responsible and respectful with your internet usage. No bit-torrent or PrOn.
* Respect other peoples personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not sure, ask them. 
* The last remaining keyholder must ask a non-keyholder to leave at the end of the night, and non-keyholders must respect keyholders' personal schedules.

## How do I connect to the wireless network? What's the difference between the two networks available?

You can access our the internet from anywhere in the building, using connections named "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" and "Indy Hall 5gHz". 
	
Mobile phones and tablets may only show 2.4gHz as an option, but if you see both options you can pick whichever one has the strongest signal. 5gHz may be noticably faster for some high-demand uses, but your milage may vary.
	
All of our wireless access points use the same password, which is included in your welcome email; ask your neighbor or one of the core team members if youâ€™re having trouble connecting.

_Short Version:_ Join the "Indy Hall 2.4gHz" network if you're not sure, and ask _anyone_ for the password.

## Where can I sit? Can/should I sit with people who do the same kind of work as me?

**Important note #1:** Hopefully, one of the reasons that you joined Indy Hall is to break away from the loneliness that happens when you work alone. So one of our #1 pieces of advice is: don't sit alone! 
	
**Important note #2:** choosing a place to sit is **NOT** permanent! You can swap seats with another member any time you want (you'll want to talk to them about it first, naturally) and every few months, we do a "reset" that allows people to move around, try new areas, and make new deskmates. 

With these notes in mind, you can sit almost anywhere you like! We've done a little bit of extra work to help you enjoy the time you spend coworking with us the most. Those color coded workclusters with light and dark surfaces aren't arranged that way because we wanted it to look like a checkerboard (though the look is cool, isn't it?). We do that to help you mix and mingle easier. Here's how it works!

![TODO Photo of Full Time Desk, set up with someone at it](http://placehold.it/600x350)

*Full-Time members are encouraged, but not required, to find an available dark colored desk* to set up shop and call home. If you choose a dark-colored desk, you can leave your belongings on the desk, and set it up to be "yours".

![TODO Photo collage of the different flex areas with people at them](http://placehold.it/600x350)

If you're a *Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member*, if you're just *dropping in for the day*, or if you're a *Full-Time member who likes to change things up* more often, you can use any of the unoccupied *light-colored work surfaces* at Indy Hall. 

Light-colored work surfaces include the desks mixed into each workcluster, the communal tables in the ground floor gallery or 2nd floor workshop, the high-top tables in the kitchen or near the 2nd floor windows, and even the round kitchen tables if you're so inclined!

**If you follow these guidelines, you'll begin to notice some pleasant side effects:**   

* *If you're a Full-Time member*, you'll get a regular changeover of different people working next to you every day. Introduce yourself and say hi when they join you!

* *And if you're a Basic, Six-Pack, or Lite member, if you're just dropping in for the day,* you can be fairly certain that you're going to be sitting next to people who know their way around Indy Hall and can help you out. Get to know your full time neighbors!

![TODO Photo of people working on the couches](http://placehold.it/600x350)

Don't be shy about working from the couches in either lounge. They can be a really nice change of pace! 

## Where do Indy Hall members like to get lunch?

Especially when you're new at Indy Hall, a really great way to get to know a few people is to get lunch together. Find out when the people who you're sitting near plan to get lunch, and ask if they'd mind showing you one of their favorite spots. Luckily, Old City has TONS of great food choices just within a couple of blocks. 

**Pro tip:** sometimes, going to lunch with a stranger can be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off (for you and for them), **try going to lunch as a group of 3**!

For choosing a lunch spot, there are dozens of options:

![TODO Map of favorite spots](http://placehold.it/600x350)

* **If you're in a hurry** - some favorite options include Lake Blue Deli, Gianfranco's Pizzaria, Sassafras Market (not to be confused with Sassafras, the bar), and a (clean!) mediterranean/hallal cart at 4th and Market. Fork, Etc is also a popular choice for slightly more upscale takeout sandwiches and salads. 

* **If you prefer to sit down** - for a meal or are planning a lunch meeting, National Mechanics is a common staple for many Indy Hall natives. You might consider your first trip to National Mechanics, be it for lunch or happy hour, an easy rite of passage to achieve! All of their menu options are great, and they have a full bar and many craft beers on tap if it's one of those kinds of lunches. 

Other popular sit down lunch options include Farmacia, Continental, Khyber Pass Pub, Race St Cafe, Wedge and Fig, Han Dynasty, and Zento Sushi. There's almost any kind of food you could want within just a couple of blocks, at almost any price point. We're (sadly) missing a grocery store in Old City :( Nobody's perfect, eh?

## What are some tips for meeting other members? 

### Tip #1: RIGHT NOW, introduce yourself online!

*Have you accepted your invitations to [our discussion list on GroupBuzz](http://indyhall.groupbuzz.io) and [our chat rooms on Hall.com](https://hall.com/invites/99091e)?* GroupBuzz is our online forum and email discussion list, while Hall.com gives you access to a collection of chat rooms occupied (and created by!) by Indy Hall members. 

Log in, spend a few minutes reading some of the existing discussions to get a feel, and then **introduce yourself!** Say a bit about what why you joined Indy Hall, what things you're interested in (don't limit yourself to work topics, people love sharing personal interests and hobbies, too). 

*Note: Can't find your invite, or don't remember your login? Email help@indyhall.org and we'll get you fixed up!*

### Tip #2: Any time you're physically at Indy Hall, introduce yourself to a person you've never met before!

*Especially* when you're new, Indy Hall can be a lot to take in, and it's not always obvious where to start. 

If you're overwhelmed, remember, **you don't have to meet everybody at once.** Stay focused on meeting one or two people at a time. 

When you sit down next to people you don't know, make eye contact and say hi, give them your name and ask for theirs. You can ask questions like, "how long have you been a member?" or "Any tips for a newbie like me?". Everyone here is interesting and loves sharing! 

**Be patient. Be curious. Be friendly. Be honest.**

### Tip #3: Meet members at events

* There are things to do with other Indy Hall members Indy Hall every week, including Working @ Night Owls & Dinner Club, joining in the conversation at Member Lunches, and Indy Hall Running Club, and B-Team trips to the comic book shop.   

    Monthly events include our ever-popular Show & Tell, various art openings, and happy hours. Over the course of the year, we also host several large parties that are open to the public. We're always looking for something to celebrate!   

    You can find out about our planned event schedule by joining our Meetup Group: http://www.meetup.com/IndyHall/events/calendar/


* You don't have to wait for an event to show up on the calendar. Every day at Indy Hall can be an event! 

    Because they're not on the calendar, you do need to keep your eyes open for improtpu gatherings in the kitchen, lounge, gallery, and other common areas. Also, keep an eye on GroupBuzz discussions & Hall chat for announcements. 

    **Have an idea for getting members together?** Awesome! If this is your first time getting members at Indy Hall organized...read below for some tips on how to be a kick ass community member. 

## How can I be a kick ass community member?

Being a great member of our community happens a bit differently than in some other  settings. It's more organic, less mechanical. This also means that often, it takes time. Trust is one of the primary currencies at Indy Hall, and it plays a big role in being a kick-ass community member.

Here's are some observations for consideration:

* In order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help. 
* In order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask for help.
* Being vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative sources
* The difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability yourself.

So with this chain of events in mind, sometimes the best way to be a PROVIDER of help is to first establish trust by receiving help rather than offering it. There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast to the entire community. 

If a large portion of your participation in the community at Indy Hall will be online, you may find it effective earn trust by listening and engaging in conversations (all the while, remembering the difference between authority and trust mentioned above) rather than trying to jump-start them without that foundation of earned trust.

Try framing it this way: instead of trying to help the "members of Indy Hall", focus on one building relationship at a time. Indy Hall is a special place where we try to make it easier to build the relationships before transactions.

## Where's a good place to park my car near Indy Hall?

Old City doesn't have a reputation as the easiest neighborhood to park in, but there are PLENTY of good options nearby (including some free ones!). Parking lots range from $8-15 for all day parking depending on when you enter and leave. Depending on the time of day, there's plentiful on-street parking, **just make sure you read signs carefully** and don't forget to set a timer to feed your meter if you're at a paid spot. Just because there isn't a meter at the spot doesn't mean it's free. If the sign says "Pay at Kiosk", you'll need to pay at one of the nearby digital kiosks and put a slip on your dashboard. 

**Important Note: The left side of 3rd Street is a tow zone during morning and afternoon rush hours.  The city enforces this and will tow you very quickly. The exact times are listed on the parking signs.**

Indy Hall members have collectively shared their best parking tips, including best lot rates, friendliest attendants and even suggested "loops" to drive to find free on-street parking: [Community Powered Parking Tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yB9avVkI1N3dcAgpFSjV8Yx9Ni3L72Y2BXod-J9yPmo/edit#heading=h.tllmi5iqibyp)

## Where are the exits? Are there any special emergency exits?

During normal operations, *all members and guests* should enter and exit from the front door at 22 N. 3rd Street. Using the elevator or the balcony stairs for non-emergency usage can be a security risk for Indy Hall members, so please, please, please, don't use them. 

*In the case of an emergency*, you can exit the 2nd floor by follow the red doors near the 3rd Street windows and take the stairs down from the balcony. The ground floor emergency exits are at the rear of the ground floor. Take the stairs down to the basement and follow the emergency exit signs to exit through the back of the building.
