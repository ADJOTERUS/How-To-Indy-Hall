# Part 2 - Help out with the "little things"

We'll just come right out and say it: Indy Hall is **not** a "serviced office", we're a **community office**. This means that if you don't clean up after yourself, you're harming the experience of other members. Sharing resources allows for amazing things to happen, but it also means that we need to take care of the things that we share. 

Indy Hall runs best when *_everyone_* follows three simple guidelines: 

* Look after yourself. 
* Look after each other. 
* Look after this place.

Here's a few simple "how to's" that can help you take care of the place that we share. 

## What should I do if I drink the last cup of coffee?

Imagine that you approach the coffee pot, place your cup underneath the spout, press down, and...drip drip drip. **Damn.** What HEATHEN would drink the last cup and not start up a fresh pot?!

Okay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But only a little.

Many members enjoy the rite of passage that comes with learning to make coffee at Indy Hall. Learning how to replenish the coffee is one of the best ways to connect with someone new at the hall, and it's a stellar way to let members know that you care about their caffiene-controlled sanity.

The big machine in the kitchen might look intimidating, but making coffee at Indy Hall is *really easy*, but don't hesitate to ask for help! Having another member guide you through making your first pot of coffee is an easy way to make a new friend. Most members sitting in close proximity to the kitchen know what's what, when it comes to the coffee machine, or you can ask for a lesson using GroupBuzz or Hall.

### For you self-starters, here's a guide

1. Hold the clear container up and under the big red grinder's nozzle, making sure the container pushes gently on the trigger that allows the machine to start grinding.

	If the grinder runs out of beans, we keep a stock under the coffee maker (right-hand side). Notice us running low on reserves? Email help@indyhall.org so we can place an order

2. Fill grounds up to the denoted line on the container - any more than that and we'll be bonding with members while clearning an awful coffee explosion.

3. Place a single filter into the filter basket. 

	If the old filter basket has used grounds in it, you can dump those into the composting can.

4. Pour the grounds into the filter, and slide the filter basket back into the machine. Make sure it's secure!

5. Press the "Start" toggle button, and listen for the gratifying "woosh" as the water begins to flow.

## The toilet paper roll is getting low. Where do we keep the toilet paper?

First of all, good lookin' out! One of the more subtle, though absolutely critical ways we take care of each other is making sure that no one gets screwed over in terms of necessary resources being available. Trust me: EVERYONE appreciates the person who restocks the TP. 

The Supply Closet is upstairs on the 2nd floor, adjacent to the North Conference Room, behind a grey door with a white sign on it! Does it look like we're running low on reserves? Drop a line to help@indyhall.org and let us know so we can place an order.

## What should I do if I use the last paper towel?

Like the TP, you can be everyone's hero and replace an empty paper towel roll with a full one.

## What should I do if the soap dispenser is running low or empty?

No one wants to shake the hand of the guy who can't lather up after using the restroom. Help that guy out and grab some soap from the Supply Closet on the 2nd floor.

## What should I do if we're running low (or run out of) coffee creamer/sugar? 

Thanks for catching that. Drop an email to help@indyhall.org and we'll stock up.

Can't wait, and want to take action? Lake Blue (3rd & Market, with the blue awning) sells both cream and sugar, just bring us a receipt and we'll credit your membership account.
